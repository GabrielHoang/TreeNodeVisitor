# TreeNodeVisitor
(Academic project)

Project implements Visitor pattern on binary expression tree. Tree can be build explicitly by creating each of its nodes and giving them value or sign and them be parsed by either:
- InFix (A + B)
- PostFix (A B +)
- Prefix (+ A B)

printers.

It can also be done the other way, by providing an expression to be parsed which is then used to create a tree out of it.
